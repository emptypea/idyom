Welcome to IDyOM's documentation!
=================================

Information Dynamics Of Music or IDyOM (`Pearce, 2005`_): a framework for constructing multiple-viewpoint variable-order Markov models for predictive statistical modelling of musical structure (see `Conklin, 1990`_, `Conklin & Witten, 1995`_). The system generates a conditional probability distribution representing the estimated likelihood of each note in a melody, given the preceding musical context; it computes Shannon entropy as a measure of uncertainty about the next note and information content as a measure of the unexpectedness of the note that actually follows.

The IDyOM software is written in the programming language Common Lisp and is made available under the `GNU General Public License`_.

Downloads and documentation:

* For downloads, installation and usage, visit the `Wiki`_.
* Further scientific publications are available `here`_.

I'd be interested to hear if you're using IDyOM in your research, so do drop me a note (marcus.pearce@qmul.ac.uk). If you would like to contribute to the development of IDyOM, please get in touch and see also the Development Roadmap for things currently in progress or planned.
