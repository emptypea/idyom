# What is Jackdaw?

Jackdaw is a toolkit for constructing probabilistic generative models of sequential data.
The toolkit is highly versatile and can be used to construct a wide range of models.
The approach bears similarity to probabilistic programming, but is slightly less general, and focused on modeling sequences.
