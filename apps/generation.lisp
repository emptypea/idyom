  "Using Metropolis-Hastings sampling, sample new pitches for the
melody <sequence>. The number of iterations can be controlled by
<iterations> which specifies a number of iterations of sampling (one
note considered per iteration) or <events> which continues until the
specified proportion of events has been changed. If both <iterations>
and <events> are specified, the specified number of iterations are run
but may be cut short if the specified proportion of events changed is
reached. The <position> parameter controls how notes are selected for
sampling: :forward proceeds forwards through the melody from the first
note to the last; :backward proceeds from the last note to the
first; :random selects note position randomly on each iteration. The
diversity of the sampling can be controlled with the <threshold>
parameter which limits sampling to events with probability above the
specified threshold (if specified) or only the highest probability
event if :max is specified. <random-state> allows the user to supply a
random state, allowing exact replication."
