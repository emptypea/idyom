## Documentation

Documentation on how to install and use IDyOM can be found at:

http://mtpearce.github.io/idyom/

The design of the system and its underlying principles are documented
in Marcus Pearce's PhD thesis "The Construction and Evaluation of
Statistical Models of Melodic Structure in Music Perception and
Composition" (2005) included here as 'thesis.pdf'. Please cite this 
thesis in any publications using this software.

## Requirements

* SBCL       http://www.sbcl.org/
* Emacs      http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/
* Quicklisp  http://www.quicklisp.org/
* Sqlite     http://www.sqlite.org/

* Idyom: fix bug in formatted output when dur/bioi/deltast/onset had null value
* Idyom: top-level command can now return entropy as well as information content
* Segmentation: add facility to detect boundaries based on both IC and entropy
* Generation: new arguments for output filename and initial context
* Testing: new tests for the Utils and Viewpoints packages (including rhythm and harmony)

### 2020-04-27: v1.6

* PPM*: update excluded counts are now incremented at the highest-order matching state (reported by Peter Harrison)
* PPM*: with update exclusion enabled, if the highest-order matching state is deterministic and there are no lower-order deterministic states, the update excluded count is used, rather than the full count
* PPM*: virtual states are now allocated correctly when more than one exists on a string transition
* PPM*: new parameter for the top-level idyom function to enable/disable exclusion 
* Viewpoints: basic temporal viewpoints (onset, bioi) are now imported correctly from Kern files when there are rests in the first bar
* Viewpionts: the metaccent and posinbar viewpoints are undefined when the time signature is not specified
* Viewpoints: added threaded viewpoints for scale degree and used clearer naming conventions for threaded viewpoints
* Utils: added SD and Pearson correlation
* Data import: don't increment voice number for empty MIDI tracks
* Apps: new top-level function in the segmentation code: (segmentation:idyom-segmentation ...)
* Apps: new similarity modelling function: (similarity:idyom-dissimilarity ...) ;; see (Pearce & Mullensiefen, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1080/09298215.2017.1305419)
* Apps: new app for Krumhansl-Schmuckler key-finding (key-finding:find-keys ...)
* Apps: new control parameters for generation (generation:idyom-generation ...)
* Output: output information gain as the KL divergence between the predictive distribution before and after a note is processed
* Output: when predicting onset, label the distribution with ioi values rather than onset values

### 2018-07-12: v1.5

* New top-level option to specify the separator to use in output files (thanks to Peter M. C. Harrison)
* new output formatting code for greater efficiency and accuracy, fixing misidentified columns when predicting onset (thanks to Peter M. C. Harrison)

* new top-level option to specify whether output files are written during viewpoint selection
* fix bug preventing viewpoint selection (reported by Niels Chr. Hansen and Ben Gold)
* viewpoint selection works for max-links = 1 and more than one target viewpoint (reported by Ben Gold)
* fix compilation issue with recent versions of SBCL (reported by Ben Gold, tested on SBCL 1.4.8)
* added timebase parameter in the music-objects code to allow for different timebases to be specified (thanks to Bastiaan van der Weij)

* new utility functions: CUMSUM, RANGE, MD5-SUM-OF-LISTS, COPY-SLOT-VALUES, INITIALISE-UNBOUND-SLOTS, SHUFFLE, ANY-DUPLICATED, RANDOM-SELECT
* midi track numbers are indexed from 1 rather than 0 (for consistency with Kern import)
* avoid negative deltast in midi import when successive notes overlap in a melody
